# Classification-and-Time-Series
A project space in which I explore various Classification algorithms and techniques and forecasting methods using Time Series. In this space I experiment with the following:
- Decision Trees
- Pruning algorithms
- Bagging algorithms
- Random Forests
- Time Series forecasting methods
